/**
 * Outgoing chat limiter: a token bucket ({@code swarmSendRatePerSec}, {@code swarmSendBurst})
 * in front of a priority queue ({@link SwarmPriority#HIGH} first, FIFO within a priority).
 *
 * <p>Vanilla 1.16.1 {@code ServerGamePacketListenerImpl} (verified from the 1.16.1 server jar
 * with Mojang's mappings): every chat packet, commands included, does
 * {@code chatSpamTickCount += 20} and disconnects non-ops with {@code disconnect.spam} when the
 * count is {@code > 200}; {@code tick()} decrements it by 1 while positive. At 20 TPS that is
 * a neutral rate of exactly 1 message/s and at most 10 back-to-back messages from zero (the
 * 11th kicks). A token bucket sends at most {@code burst + rate*T} messages in any window
 * {@code T}, so the server counter never exceeds {@code 20*burst} while {@code rate <= 1/s}.
 *
 * <p>Unless {@code allowUnsafe}, the rate is clamped to {@link #SAFE_MAX_RATE} and the burst to
 * {@link #SAFE_MAX_BURST} (peak 160 of 200), leaving room for network jitter and the player's
 * own chat. Server lag slows the decay (it is per tick), so the defaults (0.5/s, burst 5) keep
 * a margin down to 10 TPS.
